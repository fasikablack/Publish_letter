# Publish_letter
when installing packages if normal installation like pip install {package name} won't work for you try this: python -m pip install {package name} or
python3 -m pip install {package name}
# Reminder 
This django app only works with integration with odoo..it takes data from youre odoo server and publish it to pdf file but you can modify it to just publish leters by feeding it data from youre own likeing.
